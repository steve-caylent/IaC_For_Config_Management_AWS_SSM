# IaC For Config Management - AWS State Manager and Run Command

AWS Systems Manager has two other important features when it comes to config management; State Manager and Run Command. These two features allows you to automate management tasks in a secure and easy to use way. Better security is provided over traditional SSH and incoming port 22 doesn't need to be open. All connections are audited by CloudTrail and permissions can be controlled using IAM. Ansible can now be used to deploy runbooks in a more secure fashion.

## Setting up the environment

Use the same cloudformation template (below) that is used in the Session Manager demo. This will create EC2's to connect to using Ansible <br />
* SSM-Without-Bastion.yml *- for accessing EC2 via Session Manager*
<br />

![SSM Without Bastion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137347013-349e1139-a523-4fdf-a4c3-1b4d78e8041d.png)

**State Manager and Run Command can deploy Ansible to EC2 and Remote VM's with Systems Manager Agent installed**
![AWS SSM High Level](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137359824-852ab878-5015-4b8f-81f0-a84851e7b818.png)



### Installing Ansible on target instances
Ansible must be installed on the EC2 instances you intend to use. That can be done during the bootstrap process but in this example you can install it manually or with `Run Command`. See below for intalling on different distributions.

#### Amazon Linux
`sudo pip install ansible`

#### Ubuntu
`sudo apt-get install ansible -y`

#### RedHat 7
`sudo rpm -Uvh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`
`sudo yum -y install ansible`



### What will be created with initial environment

The initial environment will have the following:
* A VPC with IGW
* 3 public subnets
* EC2 Bastion Host in public subnet
* Security Group for Bastion Host allowing port 22 inbound
* public route
* 3 NAT Gateways for High Availability
* 3 private subnets
* 3 EC2 Instances - 1 in each private subnet
* Security Group for EC2 instances allowing port 22 inbound from Bastion Host
* 3 Routes for private subnets/NAT Gateways


## Setting up the environment

Use the cloudformation template below to set up the initial environment with an EC2 Bastion Host in a public subnet<br />
* SSM-Bastion.yml *- for the initial setup environment*
<br />

![SSM_Bastion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137347028-8a968a1f-acd2-4f6f-adbc-fbb686e80990.png)

As usual, wait out the setup...


### Accessing Bastion Host => Private EC2
From your remote computer make sure you have AWS CLI installed and configured as well as having the correct KeyPair .pem file.
![awscli](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137362188-56705dc4-11b1-40e3-96bc-b61f335cc3bf.png)
<br />
Using the CloudFormation Outputs find the IPs for accessing the EC2 instances
![outputs](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137362267-cc225231-ecb3-4912-afd3-a2f585254e8f.png)
<br />
First make sure SSH agent is running with your selected key pair
```
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ./PEMFILE.pem
```
Now access the bastion host with the pem file and IP address with agent forwarding
```
ssh -A -i PEMFILE.pem ec2-user@PUBLICIPOFBASTIONHOST
```
Great! Now you're connected to the Bastion Host EC2 instance in the public subnet.
<br />

### Connecting to EC2 in privates subnet via Bastion Host
Now that you've connected to the Bastion Host let's connect to a private EC2 instance

```
ssh ec2-user@PRIVATEIPofEC2
```
![privateEC2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137363799-688abbd7-0d62-4b09-9766-7bffacf9a5ef.png)


Fantastic! You've connected to the private EC2 instance. It took several steps, left an EC2 running and left port 22 open! Time to change that!

# Remote Access with AWS Systems Manager - Session Manager

### What will be created with Session Manager environment

The updated environment will have the following:
* A VPC with IGW
* 3 public subnets
* <strike>EC2 Bastion Host in public subnet</strike>
* <strike>Security Group for Bastion Host allowing port 22 inbound</strike>
* public route
* 3 NAT Gateways for High Availability
* 3 private subnets
* 3 EC2 Instances - 1 in each private subnet
* Security Group for EC2 instances <strike>allowing port 22 inbound from Bastion Host</strike> outbound port 443 only
* 3 Routes for private subnets/NAT Gateways
* 3 SSM Endpoints - 1 in each private subnet
* 3 SSM Messages Endpoints - 1 in each private subnet
* 3 SSM EC2 Messages Endpoints - 1 in each private subnet
* Security group for VPCE with inbound port 443 allowing the EC2 SG an outbound port 443 for the VPC.

### Requirements for using SSM Session Manager
* A role attached to the EC2 in a private subnet to access Session Manager.
* OS that supports SSM agent (using Linux in demo)
* SSM agent installed/started in instance (Amazon Linux 2 has by default)
  - To install SSM agent
  ``` install SSM agent
   curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/session-manager-downloads/plugin/latest/linux_64bit/session-manager-plugin.rpm" -o "session-manager-plugin.rpm"
   sudo yum install -y session-manager-plugin.rpm
* 3 VPCE endpoints for linux EC2 (Windows EC2 requires 4)
* Security Group for VPC endpoints allowing EC2 to communicate with System Manager (port 443)

## Setting up the environment for Session Manager

Use the cloudformation template below to update the stack you created above.<br />
* SSM-Without-Bastion.yml *- for accessing EC2 via Session Manager*
<br />

![SSM Without Bastion](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137347013-349e1139-a523-4fdf-a4c3-1b4d78e8041d.png)


As usual, wait out the setup...

## Accessing EC2 with Sessions Manager
Now that the VPCEâ€™s have been created you can access the EC2 from the console or AWS CLI. To access from the CLI use the instance id to connect
```
aws ssm start-session --target INSTANCE ID
```
![session](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/90650872/137368134-57d5005e-e003-455b-ab77-9673de4d1f01.png)


And that's all it takes! Easy and secure!
## Finished!

And it's as easy as that! In a few steps you've created SSM Session Manager endpoints for access to EC2 in private subnets AND with no open ports!
The benefit of having the SSM VPCE's is that you can now use Systems Manager to Run Commands, install updates and scan using Inspector.<br />
